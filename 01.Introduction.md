## About this course:
- This course is only about darts as a programming language or not going to blend in flutter.
- Dart is like any other programming language like JavaScript of Python.
- The course will be more straightforward if you know a few programming languages before because the course will not go into the basics but only outline the differences between Dart from other programming languages.
