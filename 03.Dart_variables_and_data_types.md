# Dart variable and data types

### **1. Constant (Const):**
  - Not change the value after created.
  - Not assign a new value.
  - Example code:
```
const name = 'Miu';
print(name); // Output : Miu => Accepted
name = 'gaugau'; // error: cant be assigned a new value
```
### **2. Final:** 
  - Not allow any any modification to value itself.
  - Prevent re-assigning the variable to a new value
  - Example code:
```
final age = 26;
print(age); //Output : 26 => Accepted
age = 18; // error: the final variable age can only set once
```

### **3. The difference between Const and Final:**
  - Const can't be assigned a new avalue after its creation and its internal value can't be changed either.
  - Final can't be assigned a new value but its internal value can be changed.
  - Const values can be assigned to final values but not the other way around.
  - Example code 1:
```
final age = 18;
const age2 = age; // invalid: const cannot be assigned a non-constant value
```
  - Example code 2:
```
const thisList = [1,2,3];
final thatList = thisList;
print(thisList);
print(thatList);
const someList = thatList // error: Const variable must be initialized with a constant value.
```
### **4. Late:**
  - Intialized only when they're used.
  - Example code:
```
late final yourVal = getVal();
print('we r here');
print(yourVal);

int getVal() {
    print('getVal called');
    return 10;
// Output expected: 
// getVal called
// 10

// Actual output:
// we r here
//getVal called
//10
}
```

### **5. Naming convention:**
  - Variable names : the first word of the variable name should be lowercase and the first letter of all the consecutive words should be uppercase, and the rest of the consecutive words should be lowercase.
  - Example code:
```
final double hisAge = 30; 
String herName = "Chloe";
double HisName = "Don"; // error

```
### **6. Declare new variable: if type can be assigned or not, but once assigned, type cannot be changed**
```
String name = “Chloe”;     // accepted
String name = 25;          // error : String type should include charactor not a number.

var address =’’ ;            //<name> has type “String”
address = 1810;               // error: String type should include charactor not a number.
```

### **7. Type promotion:**
```
final double number = 10 ;  // ok : 10 can be 10.0
final int number = 10.5 ;  // error: 10.5 can't be 10, do not use less precise type for more precise type.
```

### **8. Another data type: simlilar to another programming language.**

  - Number (int, double):
```
int nums = 2;
double nums = 2.2;
double nums = ' Twenty Two'; // error: double only accepted number in value
```
- String:
```
String herName = 'Chau'; //Accepted
String herName = 1; //error : String type should include charactor not a number.
```
  - Booleans (bool):
```
const bool topLevel = true; // value is true or false
```
  - Lists (List, also known as arrays):
```
const List<int> someList = [1,2,3];
```
  - Map (Map):
```
const Map<String, String> someMap = {'key': 'value'}; // a pair
print(someMap['value']); // output : value
```
  - Set:
```
const Set<int> someSet = {1,2,3};
```
  - Dynamic: null value
```
const dynamic someNull = null;
```
  - Symbol:
```
const Symbol someSymbol = #someNull;
```
